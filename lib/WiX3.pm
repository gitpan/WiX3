=head1 NAME

WiX3 - Objects useful for generating Windows Installer XML files.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes WiX3 version 0.010003

=for readme continue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution is designed to assist in writing XML files for Windows Installer XML
version 3.0, otherwise known as WiX.

Since Windows Installer, and therefore WiX, keeps track of each individual 
file, installers using it are more complicated than other installers.

This distribution, therefore contains Moose classes that represent different 
WiX tags to keep track of files, directories, etc.

=begin readme

=head1 INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:
