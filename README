WiX3 Version 0.010001

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is designed to assist in writing XML files for Windows
    Installer XML version 3.0, otherwise known as WiX.

    Since Windows Installer, and therefore WiX, keeps track of each
    individual file, installers using it are more complicated than other
    installers.

    This distribution, therefore contains Moose classes that represent
    different WiX tags to keep track of files, directories, etc.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    This method of installation will install a current version of
    Module::Build if it is not already installed.

    Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following
    commands:

            perl Build.PL
            ./Build
            ./Build test
            ./Build install

DEPENDENCIES
    Moose, Exception::Class (more to add later)

WARNING
    This distribution is not nearly complete yet - it is still in an alpha
    state.
